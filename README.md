etp-api
=======

**etp-api** is a framework for a web service that provides an API for aggregated ETP outcomes. The default setting for the server is Heroku with Heroku Postgres database. The goal is for every institution to have an easy deployment for their ETP outcomes that could be used in more sophisticated tools, analyses and downstream applications by developers.
